# 🌿 CO₂ Emission Calculator

A web-based calculator that helps users estimate carbon dioxide emissions for their journeys based on origin, destination, and transportation mode. This project promotes environmental awareness by providing insights into the environmental impact of different travel choices.

## 🎯 Features

- **Route Calculation**: Enter origin and destination addresses to automatically calculate distance
- **Manual Distance Input**: Option to manually enter distance when automatic calculation isn't available
- **Multiple Transport Modes**: Choose from bicycle, car, bus, or truck
- **Emission Calculation**: Real-time CO₂ emission estimates based on transport mode and distance
- **Comparison View**: Compare emissions across different transportation options
- **Carbon Credits**: Information on carbon offset opportunities
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Auto-complete**: City suggestions for easier address entry

## 🎨 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with BEM methodology
- **CSS3**: Custom properties, responsive design, and modern styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modular architecture with separate files for different functionalities
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment and hosting
